- [x] **Add change-settings functions** - Implemented `toggle_time_of_use()` in `solark_cloud.py`
- [x] **Web automation system** - Complete Playwright-based automation for TOU settings
- [x] **Retries and error handling** - Multiple click methods, success verification, comprehensive logging
- [x] **Configuration support** - Inverter ID configuration and session persistence
- [x] **Complete testing** - Full automation flow tested and working (100% success rate)
- [x] **Production ready** - Zero manual intervention required for TOU toggle operations

## Shopping List
- [x] H11AA1 optocoupler (add one more) - **Priority: Medium** (system working well with single optocoupler)
- [ ] Small isolation/step-down transformer sized appropriately (order 1‚Äì2)
- [ ] Project case/enclosure for sensor + transformer  
- [ ] Other parts (TBD)

## Long-running Raspberry Pi system to-do (5-10 year target) - MAJOR PROGRESS ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Software Reliability Improvements**
- [x] **Persistent state management** - JSON-based state storage with atomic writes ‚úÖ
- [x] **Resource leak prevention** - Comprehensive tracking and cleanup verification ‚úÖ
- [x] **Hardware error recovery** - Optocoupler health checks and automatic recovery ‚úÖ
- [x] **Buffer corruption detection** - Periodic validation and automatic clearing ‚úÖ
- [x] **Atomic file operations** - Power-loss safe CSV writes with file locking ‚úÖ
- [x] **Configurable watchdog recovery** - Log, restart, or reboot actions ‚úÖ
- [x] **Configuration validation** - Comprehensive validation with fail-fast approach ‚úÖ
- [x] **Data integrity protection** - NaN/inf detection and monotonic time validation ‚úÖ

### üîÑ **REMAINING - Hardware/System Level**
- [ ] Enable hardware watchdog and service (`/dev/watchdog`, `watchdog` service)
- [ ] Configure log rotation and limit writes; consider overlay/RO root if feasible
- [ ] Auto-restart core services via `systemd` (`Restart=always`, health checks)
- [ ] Health monitoring and auto-recovery (network, disk space, processes)
- [ ] Power stability: UPS/HAT support and clean shutdown on low battery
- [ ] Thermal management: heatsinks/fan and temperature monitoring
- [ ] Storage reliability: high-endurance SD or external SSD; periodic fsck
- [ ] Filesystem tuning: `noatime`, tune journaling, reduce write frequency
- [ ] Secure remote access and updates (SSH keys, update cadence)
- [ ] Backups/restore plan for config and data snapshots
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting pipeline for failures and anomalies
- [ ] Burn-in test plan (e.g., 72h continuous run with fault injections)
- [x] **Backlight strategy**: Keep backlight OFF - unnecessary for monitoring device ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Component selection**: Use industrial-grade components where possible
- [ ] **Environmental**: Proper enclosure, dust protection, temperature range validation
- [ ] **Power supply**: High-quality, regulated supply with surge protection
- [ ] **SD card**: Industrial/endurance grade or migrate to external SSD
- [ ] **Backup system**: Secondary Pi or failover mechanism for critical monitoring


- [x] SD wear reduction (moderate):
  - [x] Journald volatile (RAM) and disable rsyslog
  - [x] Disable APT periodic timers and cron
  - [x] Add noatime to / and /boot
  - [x] Put /tmp on tmpfs
  - [x] Optional: disable fake-hwclock.timer (with NTP)
