## RpiSolArk To-Do

### 1) Screen backlight management for longevity
- [ ] Identify screen model and backlight control interface on device
- [ ] **Turn off backlight completely** - unnecessary for monitoring device
- [ ] Remove any backlight control code to simplify system
- [ ] Focus on data logging/remote monitoring instead of local display

### 2) Multiple H1AA1 modules working concurrently
- [ ] Add multi-H1AA1 input support to GPIO and pulse counter
- [ ] Extend config schema to define multiple H1AA1 channels
- [ ] Implement per-channel calibration and cross-talk validation tests
- [ ] Bench test two H1AA1s concurrently and record accuracy

### 3) Sol-Ark: change settings on grid loss/restore
- [ ] Enumerate Sol-Ark API endpoints to change required settings
- [ ] Add change-settings functions for both inverters in `solark_cloud.py`
- [ ] Wire grid-loss/restore events to trigger Sol-Ark setting changes
- [ ] Implement retries, idempotency, and audit logging around API calls
- [ ] Add configuration for inverter IDs and loss/restore setting profiles
- [ ] Create tests simulating loss/restore to verify settings are applied

## Shopping List
- [ ] H11AA1 optocoupler (add one more)
- [ ] Small isolation/step-down transformer sized appropriately (order 1â€“2)
- [ ] Project case/enclosure for sensor + transformer
- [ ] Other parts (TBD)

## Long-running Raspberry Pi system to-do (5-10 year target)
- [ ] Enable hardware watchdog and service (`/dev/watchdog`, `watchdog` service)
- [ ] Configure log rotation and limit writes; consider overlay/RO root if feasible
- [ ] Auto-restart core services via `systemd` (`Restart=always`, health checks)
- [ ] Health monitoring and auto-recovery (network, disk space, processes)
- [ ] Power stability: UPS/HAT support and clean shutdown on low battery
- [ ] Thermal management: heatsinks/fan and temperature monitoring
- [ ] Storage reliability: high-endurance SD or external SSD; periodic fsck
- [ ] Filesystem tuning: `noatime`, tune journaling, reduce write frequency
- [ ] Secure remote access and updates (SSH keys, update cadence)
- [ ] Backups/restore plan for config and data snapshots
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting pipeline for failures and anomalies
- [ ] Burn-in test plan (e.g., 72h continuous run with fault injections)
- [ ] **Backlight strategy**: Keep backlight OFF - unnecessary for monitoring device
- [ ] **Component selection**: Use industrial-grade components where possible
- [ ] **Environmental**: Proper enclosure, dust protection, temperature range validation
- [ ] **Power supply**: High-quality, regulated supply with surge protection
- [ ] **SD card**: Industrial/endurance grade or migrate to external SSD
- [ ] **Backup system**: Secondary Pi or failover mechanism for critical monitoring
