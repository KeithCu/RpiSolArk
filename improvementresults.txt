🎯 CRITICAL OPTCOUPLER IMPROVEMENT TESTING
============================================================
Testing the most important improvements individually
Target: 60.01 Hz
============================================================
🕐 CRITICAL TEST 1: TIMING PRECISION
==================================================
Comparing time.time() vs time.perf_counter()

📊 Original method (time.time()):
  Pulses: 1257 in 10.000s
  Frequency: 62.8500 Hz
  Error: 2.8400 Hz
  Accuracy: 95.27%

🎯 High-precision method (time.perf_counter()):
  Pulses: 1264 in 10.000s
  Frequency: 63.2000 Hz
  Error: 3.1900 Hz
  Accuracy: 94.68%

💡 Timing improvement: ⚠️  MINIMAL IMPACT

📊 CRITICAL TEST 2: SIGNAL QUALITY
==================================================
Testing signal stability and quality

📊 Signal quality test:
  Frequency: 63.7500 Hz
  Error: 3.7400 Hz
  Accuracy: 93.77%

💡 Signal quality: ⚠️  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

📈 CRITICAL TEST 3: CONSISTENCY
==================================================
Testing measurement consistency over multiple readings

📊 Consistency test (5 measurements, 10s each):
  Measurement 1/5:
    Result: 63.7500 Hz
  Measurement 2/5:
    Result: 63.8000 Hz
  Measurement 3/5:
    Result: 63.4000 Hz
  Measurement 4/5:
    Result: 63.6000 Hz
  Measurement 5/5:
    Result: 65.3500 Hz

  Consistency analysis:
    Average frequency: 63.9800 Hz
    Standard deviation: 0.7815 Hz
    Error: 3.9700 Hz
    Accuracy: 93.38%

💡 Consistency: ⚠️  VARIABLE

🏁 Critical testing completed!
💡 Look for tests marked as 'HELPFUL' - those are worth keeping
💡 Tests marked as 'MINIMAL IMPACT' might not be necessary for your setup
