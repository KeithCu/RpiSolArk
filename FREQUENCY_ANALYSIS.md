# 🔬 Frequency Analysis & Power Source Detection

*This document provides detailed technical information about how the RpiSolArkMonitor detects power sources through frequency analysis. For a high-level overview, see the [main README](README.md).*

## 📖 Overview

The RpiSolArkMonitor solves a critical challenge: **How do you automatically detect whether your home is powered by the utility grid or a backup generator?** This detection is essential for automatic inverter parameter switching, load management decisions, safety systems, and energy management optimization.

The solution uses **frequency analysis** because unlike voltage (which can be similar for both sources), **frequency behavior is dramatically different** between utility grid and generators.

## 🔍 What is Frequency Hunting?

**Frequency hunting** is a characteristic instability pattern where a generator's frequency oscillates around the target frequency (60 Hz) in a cyclical pattern. This is the "smoking gun" that distinguishes generators from utility power.

### 🎯 **Why Generators Hunt:**

1. **Mechanical Governor Response**: The governor tries to maintain 3600 RPM (60 Hz), but:
   - Load changes cause speed variations
   - Governor overcorrects, causing overshoot
   - System oscillates around target speed
   - Creates characteristic hunting pattern

2. **Engine Characteristics**:
   - Single-cylinder engines have more hunting than multi-cylinder
   - Air-cooled engines hunt more than liquid-cooled
   - Older generators hunt more than newer ones
   - Load-dependent hunting (more load = more hunting)

3. **Governor Design**:
   - Mechanical governors are inherently less stable
   - Electronic governors are better but still hunt
   - Hunting frequency typically 0.1-2 Hz (every 0.5-10 seconds)

### 📊 **Real-World Generator Hunting Examples:**

**Generac Guardian 20kW:**
```
Pattern: 61-62 Hz → 59-60 Hz → 61-62 Hz (every 3-5 seconds)
Cause: Governor hunting under load changes
Detection: High Allan variance + cycling pattern
```

**Generac V-Twin 16kW:**
```
Pattern: 59-60 Hz baseline, drops to 57-58 Hz under load
Cause: Load-dependent frequency regulation
Detection: Standard deviation + load correlation
```

**Portable Generators (XG7000E):**
```
Pattern: 59-60 Hz ±1 Hz hunting (no load), 49-62 Hz (loaded)
Cause: Extreme governor instability
Detection: Very high kurtosis + wide frequency range
```

## 🧮 **Detection Algorithm**

The system uses **three complementary analysis methods**:

| Analysis Method | What It Detects | Why It Works |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **📊 Allan Variance** | Short-term frequency instability | Captures hunting oscillations |
| **📈 Standard Deviation** | Overall frequency spread | Detects wide frequency ranges |
| **📉 Kurtosis** | Distribution shape analysis | Identifies hunting patterns vs random noise |

### 🔬 **The Math Behind Detection:**

```python
# Convert frequency to fractional frequency for analysis
frac_freq = (frequency - 60.0) / 60.0

# Allan Variance: Detects hunting patterns
allan_variance = calculate_allan_variance(frac_freq, tau=10.0)

# Standard Deviation: Overall instability
std_deviation = np.std(frac_freq * 60.0)

# Kurtosis: Pattern detection (hunting vs noise)
kurtosis = scipy.stats.kurtosis(frac_freq)

# Classification logic
if (allan_variance > threshold OR 
    std_deviation > threshold OR 
    kurtosis > threshold):
    return "Generac Generator"
else:
    return "Utility Grid"
```

### 🎯 **Why This Works So Well**

1. **Utility Grid**: Massive interconnected system with thousands of generators provides rock-solid frequency stability
2. **Generators**: Single engine with mechanical governor creates characteristic hunting patterns
3. **Pattern Recognition**: The combination of three metrics catches different types of instability
4. **Real-World Tested**: Algorithm trained on actual generator data from various models

## 🔬 **Detailed Analysis: Detection Metrics Explained**

### 📊 **Standard Deviation - The Primary Indicator**

**What it measures:** How spread out frequency values are from the mean.

**Formula:** `std_dev = sqrt(sum((x - mean)^2) / N)`

**Why it's effective:**
- **Utility Grid**: Very stable frequency (0.01-0.05 Hz std dev)
- **Generators**: Inherently unstable (0.5-10+ Hz std dev)

**Advantages:**
- Simple to calculate (basic statistics)
- Fast computation (O(n) complexity)
- Intuitive to understand
- Works with any sample size
- No external library dependencies

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't capture temporal patterns
- Sensitive to outliers
- Doesn't distinguish between different types of instability

**Real-world performance:** 100% detection rate (12/12 generator patterns detected)

### 📈 **Allan Variance - The Temporal Pattern Detector**

**What it measures:** Frequency stability over time, specifically designed to detect systematic frequency variations and drift patterns.

**Formula:** `allan_var = (1/2) * E[(y(t+tau) - y(t))^2]`

**Why it's effective:**
- **Utility Grid**: Very stable over time (1e-6 to 1e-5 Allan variance)
- **Generators**: Systematic hunting patterns (1e-4 to 1e-2 Allan variance)

**What it detects:**
1. **Governor Hunting**: Cyclical frequency variations (60 Hz → 59 Hz → 61 Hz → 60 Hz)
2. **Load-Dependent Drift**: Frequency changes with load (60 Hz no load → 58 Hz loaded)
3. **Startup Instability**: Initial frequency settling (50 Hz → 55 Hz → 60 Hz startup)

**Advantages:**
- Detects systematic frequency variations
- Captures temporal patterns and hunting
- Less sensitive to random noise
- Industry standard for frequency stability analysis
- Good at detecting governor hunting cycles

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to calculate
- Requires sufficient data points
- Sensitive to sampling rate
- Requires external library (allantools)
- Can be computationally expensive

**Real-world performance:** 75% detection rate (9/12 generator patterns detected)

### 📉 **Kurtosis - The Distribution Shape Analyzer**

**What it measures:** The 'tailedness' of the frequency distribution - whether data has heavy tails or is more peaked than normal.

**Formula:** `K = E[(X - mean)^4] / std_dev^4 - 3`

**Kurtosis values:**
- Kurtosis = 0: Normal distribution (bell curve)
- Kurtosis > 0: Heavy tails, more peaked (leptokurtic)
- Kurtosis < 0: Light tails, flatter (platykurtic)

**Why it might be effective:**
- **Utility Grid**: Normal distribution (kurtosis ~ 0)
- **Generators**: Non-normal distributions (kurtosis ≠ 0)

**What it detects:**
1. **Hunting Patterns**: Bimodal distributions (59 Hz and 61 Hz clusters)
2. **Extreme Swings**: Heavy-tailed distributions (mostly 60 Hz with occasional 50-70 Hz)
3. **Startup Surges**: Initial instability (normal 60 Hz with startup spikes)

**Advantages:**
- Detects non-normal frequency distributions
- Good at identifying hunting patterns
- Captures extreme frequency swings
- Simple to calculate

**Disadvantages:**
- Less intuitive than standard deviation
- Sensitive to sample size
- Can be misleading with small datasets
- Not as reliable as other metrics

**Real-world performance:** 25% detection rate (3/12 generator patterns detected)

### 🎯 **Metric Effectiveness Summary**

| Metric | Detection Rate | Complexity | Dependencies | Recommendation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Standard Deviation** | 100% (12/12) | Low | None | ✅ **Primary metric** |
| **Allan Variance** | 75% (9/12) | Medium | allantools | ✅ **Secondary metric** |
| **Kurtosis** | 25% (3/12) | Low | scipy | ⚠️ **Consider removing** |

### 💡 **Simplification Analysis**

**Key Finding:** Standard deviation alone achieves 100% detection accuracy!

**Simplification options:**
1. **Current approach**: All three metrics (100% accuracy, more complex)
2. **Simplified approach**: Standard deviation only (100% accuracy, much simpler)
3. **Moderate approach**: Standard deviation + Allan variance (100% accuracy, moderate complexity)

**Recommendation:** Based on real-world testing, you could simplify to **standard deviation only** and maintain 100% detection accuracy while significantly reducing code complexity and dependencies.
